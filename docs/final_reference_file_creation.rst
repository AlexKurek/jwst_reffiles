.. _final_reffile:

Create final reference files
----------------------------

The creation of *final* reference files is similar to that of the *individual* reference files, where the user can plug in a module that takes as input a list of *individual* reference files and produces (and saves) a *final* reference file.

Several basic and widely-uised combination methods (simple pixel-by-pixel mean, median, etc) will be included in the *jwst_reffiles* package for convenience.
